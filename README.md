# Jasy

Jasy(moon, in guarani language) is an iOS app that works with Astronomy Picture of the Day API service(APOD). Users can search apods by month and year, between 1995-06-16 and the current day. All filtered apods will be shown in a collection.

The refresh button gets the lastest apods.

Users can tap a picture, zoom it and read its explanation.
